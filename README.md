# wordlists

Some word lists for fuzzing and brute forcing.

* [general.txt](general.txt) - mostly technology and business related general terms.
* [mozilla.txt](mozilla.txt) - derived from browsing most of the firefox/mozilla web pages and the [web services bug bounty program](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/web-bug-bounty/) pages.
